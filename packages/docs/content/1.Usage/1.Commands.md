# Commands

## Configurations

When registering a command, you can configure its trigger name, alias, description, and list of subcommands, which Mustard supports in the form of parameter lists or objects:

```typescript
@Command('run')
@Command('run', 'r')
@Command('run', 'run command handle')
@Command('run', 'r', 'run command handle')
@Command('run', [RunSubCommandHandle])
@Command({
  name: 'run',
  alias: 'r',
  description: 'run command handle',
  subCommands: [RunSubCommandHandle]
})
class RunCommandHandle implements CommandStruct {
  public run() {}
}
```

::list{type="info"}
To split `@Command('run', 'r')` and `@Command('run', 'run command handle')` overloads, if you provide a string which length is less than 3, it will be treated as alias, otherwise it will be treated as description.

## Nested Commands

Mustard supports infinite levels of nested commands, and you can also use `@Command` decorator to register subcommands:

```typescript
@Command('log')
class RunSyncLogCommandHandle implements CommandStruct {
  public run() {}
}

@Command('sync', [RunSyncLogCommandHandle])
class RunSyncCommandHandle implements CommandStruct {
  public run() {}
}

@Command('update')
class RunUpdateCommandHandle implements CommandStruct {
  public run() {}
}

@Command('run', [RunSyncCommandHandle, RunUpdateCommandHandle])
class RunCommandHandle implements CommandStruct {
  public run() {}
}
```
